# Angular7Firestore

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.1.

A web application for registering new employees. One can edit an entry and as well as delete an entry too.

The database used is Firestore which is part of Google's Firebase. You can read about the difference between Firebase and Firestore [here](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2017/10/cloud-firestore-for-rtdb-developers.html) and in the offical documentation [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/rtdb-vs-firestore).

I used Twitter's [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/download/) for the UI.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
